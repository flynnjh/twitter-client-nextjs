# A Twitter Client built with NextJS

This project sill needs oAUTH authentication to be implemented, but I will continue to update it when I can. I wanted to build it as my first NextJS project, and it went well. I'm leaving it as is because I can't implement proper oAuth authentication without an entire rewrite â€“ which wouldn't be worth my time. If you want to use this project yourself, make a .env.local at the root with the required api keys in the api/ directory.
